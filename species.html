            All cows are actually considered female. Males are known as steer or bulls.  The female cow is a heifer until she has a calf.
            Cows are VEGETARIAN!! Just like Taylor our creator.
            Cows can see almost 360 degrees, but not very well straight in front of them.  Those are some big eyes!
            Cows like to be alone, they like to have friends.  So if you have a farm, remember to create a cute Instagram account for your cows so they will be in a better mooooo-d.
            Cows have an average of 32 teeth.
            Cows spend around 10 hours laying down and chillin out. So I think it’s time to hang out with your cows and put on a fun mooo-vie.

        <h1  style="text-align: center; color:#F2668B;  background-color: #4CABA6;" > Lion Facts</h1>
      
        <p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; background-color:#F2CDAC;">In the wild, there are two formally recognised lion subspecies. The African lion (Panthera leo leo) is found in Africa, south of the Sahara desert. The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) exists in one small population around Gir Forest National Park in western India.

            Wild lions in the west and central Africa are more closely related to these Asiatic lions in India than to those found in southern and east Africa.On average, male lions weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone). 

            They need this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride. Young lions have rosettes and spots on their sandy coats, but these generally disappear as they mature.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; background-color:#F2CDAC ; ">	
                The African Savanna (Bush) elephant is the world's largest land animal – with adult males, or bull elephants, standing up to 3m high and weighing up to 6,000kg on average. Males only reach their full size at 35-40 years - that’s well over half their lifespan as wild elephants can live for up to 60-70 years.

                And it’s not just the adults – even calves are huge! At birth, a baby elephant can weigh 120kg - that’s almost 19 stone.There are three species of elephant: African Savanna (Bush), African Forest and Asian. The ears of African elephants are much larger than their cousins and are described as being shaped like the African continent, whereas the ears of Asian elephants are shaped like the Indian subcontinent.
